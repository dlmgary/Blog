# Ad-based crowdsourcing platform

Feb. 29, 2020. 

## Customer Feedback

Okay, it's time to update you on the ad-based crowdsourcing platform. 

The beauty of talking to customers is that it allows you to have a better understanding of their needs. From talking to a couple of potential customers, I learned the following things about their fundraising events:
Small organizations (i.e., college clubs) have 2-3 fundraising events per year.
Each event raises hundredths, not thousands, of dollars, usually somewhere in the low hundredths. 
Those events are put together by 4-5 people.

The information was, indeed, beneficial. I had grossly overestimated the amount of money small college clubs raised. It appears that most of them require the financial backing of universities to cover for their most significant expenses (e.g., travel, uniforms, equipment). 

From the different interviews, I learned that users would be willing to use the platform, and share it with their peers, if it would help them raise comparable amounts to traditional fundraising events. Therefore, if they were to use this as a continuous fundraising campaign, they would need at least about $100 of monthly revenue. 

## Running numbers

Initially, that didn't sound like much, so I calculated the number of ad views each site would need to make $100 a month. Using Google AdSense (https://www.google.com/adsense/start/), I made a back of the envelope calculation to estimate how many ad impressions are needed to reach $100 of revenue a month. 

- $100 per month =  ~10,000 ad impressions per month.  

That number is based solely on ad impressions. As I spoke with different people, the idea of showing videos came up. I contacted different companies to try to get estimates but did not have much luck. I will continue contacting them.  

Some of the other vital take aways are more related to how the site should work. 
- The site should be gamefied. 
- Make progress evident to everybody.
- Users have a short-term attention span
- It's unlikely that users will share the link month-to-month, or that all members of the organization would share the link. 
- Have milestones, and each milestone should have a reward (e.g., it can be a picture or something new unlocked). 

Anyways. I think that's all for now. Still need to add more material here.

Cheers,
