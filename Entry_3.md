# Naming

### Hi there, Gary here, 

It's only been one day since the challenge started. And my obsessive-compulsive disorder hasn't let me stop thinking about this challenge. Oh well, isn't every successful entrepreneur a bit mad? 

I've been trying to mature the idea a bit more; this is what I have so far. Users will create campaigns to raise money for their organization. All I know is that it should be a straightforward process if people are to sign up. After they create the campaign, they get a link to their landing page. Then, they share the link with people, and they start making money. A month or so after they start the campaign, they get the ads revenue money. Not too complicated, right?

Anyways, I've promised myself not to start coding until I have talked with some potential customers. Ideally, I want to sign them up before I create the website. So, maybe the best way forward will be to create some simple mockups and explain the idea. For this, I've already set up a meeting with a potential customer. 

Also, I'm horrible when it comes to naming things. So I'm going to talk with some buddies of mine and try to get their feedback on some silly names. The list of names is somewhat broad at the moment, but I hope they will help me narrow it down. Check some of the potential candidates below so that you can convince yourself of my less-than-optimal naming skills. 


I used te [Lean Doman Search][1] to generate the names. The words I used were: raise, boost, lift, rise. 

- RaiseFly
- RaiseStuff
- RaisePod
- RaiseMod
- RaiseCall
- RaisePass
- PocketRaise
- BoostPit
- BoostSaver
- MapleBoost
- BoostArmy
- QuietArmy
- BoostRow
- LiftStorm
- RiseSnap
- RiseBlast
- RiseKick

Cheers,

-Gary
