# Introduction

### Hi there,

My name is Gary, and this is my first blog post ever. Brace yourself for an exciting and somewhat unpredictable ride. This blog's objective is pretty simple; I want to bring you on my journey as I build the next multi-million-dollar startup. Every journey begins with a step, and this constitutes the proverbial first step. 

A couple of weeks ago, I became inspired by [Nathan Barry's Web App Challenge][1] that led to the creation of ConverKit. The idea behind the challenge is simple enough, smart with a small budget, no business idea or model, and set yourself a monthly revenue goal to achieve in six months. Let's be honest; how difficult can this be? I'm a firm believer in exposure therapy, and what better way to publicly shame myself into being successful than writing posts about my weekly achievements (or lack thereof). And what better way to accomplish that than sharing this blog with all my friends, coworkers, and people I've never met so we can all walk through this journey together. 

Starting the challenge
Today, February 19th, 2020, I officially accept the Web App Challenge, with the stipulations shown below:
- The initial budget is $5,000.
- Twenty-hours work week. 
- And the deadline is six months from today (August 19th, 2020). 

##  Let's get started, shall we? 

At heart, I'm a tech person. So, it is natural that this new business of mine will be tech-related. Why tech? Simple. It is the only discipline I know that is not capital intensive (at least at the beginning) that it can quickly scale to a global audience. 

I have a hunch that if this business is to be successful, it needs to be "out there." Meaning, whatever product or service it sells has to be silly. So silly that most sane people would not want to invest their time, money, or effort developing. That's until, of course, it becomes profitable, mainstream, and ultimately obvious. 

Let's be honest. I still don't understand why people care to share with strangers their spending habits and day-to-day transactions. Or why people send each other messages that will self-destruct before you even get to read them. Or even worse, why people want to share videos of themselves doing silly things with people. Yet, Venmo, Snapchat, and TikTok seem to be doing great. 

Maybe that's the [key][2]. Build something silly that people enjoy and have a good time using. I don't know about you, my friend, but we might be onto something here.

Anyhow, this will cut if for the first blog post. I can't believe we already started the journey. Take a second and take a deep breath. Can you smell that? It feels like our thousand-mile journey just began. Ultimately, for those of you reading this, thank you. It means a lot to me that you're putting up with my sub-optimal writing skills.

Cheers,

-Gary
