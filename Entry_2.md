# Ideation and Brainstorming

## Hi there, Gary here. 

We are still in day one of the challenge I wrote the first blog entry just a couple of hours ago (you can check it [here][1]), but I thought my progress merited an update. After all, what is a blog without any posts? 

## The idea

Let's face it; ads are annoying. Yes, they sometimes show an exciting product, but most of the time, they are in-your-face annoying. And, possibly, what's worse, we don't get to enjoy the benefits (money) that ads generate. Endless hours spent looking at ads for all the money to end in the ether. That's certainly a problem that must us have faced. But what if there could be a better way...

What if instead of giving all that money to the website, we could channel part of the money to our favorite organizations, or even better, us. After all, money is getting moved. Why not disrupt the cycle for a better cause? 

The idea is simple, create a website where organizations can send their followers. Instead of asking for a donation, you ask for some time. Want to donate a bit more? Please encourage them to linger around the site a bit longer. The more ads they see, the more they're contributing. It's that simple; no credit card required. 

## Market Research

I've done some quick background research and could not find other companies doing similar things. This idea certainly checks the "silliness" box. Because let's be real, who would think that watching ads can make you money? 

I looked at some ways to publish ads and video ads on websites. Google AdSense might be a good fit for showing the regular ads, and OpenX might be a good fit for showing video ads. At this stage, I'll leave the tech side of things alone. As a technologist, I have to resist the urge to start building something before I have some validation that other people find it useful.

At this stage, organizations raising funds appear to be the right target audience. Getting to them shouldn't be too difficult. The plan for the next couple of days is to continue the research and talk with some customers. Let's see if we can get some customers before we write a single line of code. 

Also, I bought the domain www.garybits.com to host all these blogs. If we're going to have a blog, we're going to need a place where to put them.

## Time and money used

So far, I've probably spent a couple of hours brainstorming, doing some research, and buying the domain. 

Time:
- 2 hours: brainstorming 
- 2 hours: doing market research on similar ideas
Money:
- $34: domain registration (www.GaryBits.com and www.GaryBit.com). 

For now, I think this concludes the second entry of this blog. Thank you for sticking with me, my fellow companion. Talk to you in the next post. 

Cheers,

-Gary
